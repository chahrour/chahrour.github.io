DESCRIPTION:Department of Economics Workshop\n\nTuesday\, March 25\, 202
 5\n8:45 a.m. – 10:00 a.m.\, 225 ILR CC\n\nNicholas Swanson\n(Stanford Un
 iversity)\n\nUnder-Training by Employers in Informal Labor Markets:\nEvi
 dence from Burundi\nAbstract: Workers in LMICs obtain limited human capi
 tal through on-the-job experience\, but the reasons for this are unclear
 . We test whether one friction contributes to low worker productivity: f
 irms’ unwillingness to train because they do not appropriate the returns
  from training. We study casual labor markets in Burundi\, where employe
 rs can train workers in a newly introduced agricultural practice in the 
 region\, row planting—a technique that substantially raises yields. In a
  first field experiment\, in some randomly selected local labor markets 
 (villages)\, we induce one-third of employers to train workers in row pl
 anting\, which leads to a 20 p.p. increase in the share of skilled worke
 rs in the village. Training generates meaningful economic returns: emplo
 yers in treated villages increase their adoption of row planting by 10 p
 .p. (20%)\, which raises farm profitability by 9%. However\, employers f
 ail to appropriate most of this surplus: Two-thirds of it is captured by
  non-training employers because many of the trained workers work for oth
 er people after the training. In a second experiment\, we randomize empl
 oyers into a condition that increases the likelihood that the worker wil
 l return to work for the employer in the future. Employers receiving thi
 s guarantee are 50 p.p. likelier to train the worker. This suggests that
  the wedge between the private and social returns from investments meani
 ngfully reduces worker productivity.\n\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://cor
